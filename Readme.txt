Obesity Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository presents a structured analysis of obesity-related data, leveraging both Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to identify key contributing factors to obesity and build predictive models that can assist in early detection and risk classification.

Project Objectives
    • Understand patterns and correlations in obesity-related factors
    • Clean and preprocess obesity data for EDA analysis 
    • Apply ML and DL models for classification and prediction
    • Evaluate model performance and interpret key findings
    • Support analysis with academic research

Techniques Used
    • Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling
    • EDA: Visualizing distributions, relationships, and trends
    • ML Models: Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier    
    • DL Models: Fully Connected Feedforward Neural Networks (Keras/TensorFlow)

Research Papers
The research_papers/ folder contains relevant academic studies on obesity trends, and its machine learning applications. The folders consists of both conference and journal papers that are related to obesity. These papers support the analytical approach and model design choices made in this project.
